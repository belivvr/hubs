### Feature Overview

**Title:** Request to Add Fixed Avatar Rotation in Third-Person View
* Developer: fstory97@gmail.com
* Work Period: 2025-01

**Current Situation:**
When clicking the third-person button (currently only available on PC), the camera moves behind the avatar to show its back view. However, when rotating with right-click mouse drag, the camera rotation causes the avatar to rotate as well, making it difficult to properly view the avatar.

**Requirements:**
Like typical PC online games, please improve the functionality so that in third-person view, only the camera rotates while the avatar remains fixed. This will allow users to more easily examine their avatar's appearance.

**Expected Benefits:**
- Enhanced user experience
- Improved avatar visual representation
- Increased game immersion

**Source Code Analysis**

1. Project Location:
 - Mouse input
 - Camera rotation
 - Avatar rotation

2. Implementation
- Third-person view toggle button is implemented in ui-root.js
- Mode switching exists between CAMERA_MODE_FIRST_PERSON and CAMERA_MODE_THIRD_PERSON_VIEW
- Camera behavior is controlled in camera-system.js

3. Modifications
  - In camera-system.js for CAMERA_MODE_THIRD_PERSON_VIEW mode:
  - Modified to prevent avatar rotation during camera rotation
  - Implemented independent camera rotation
  - Separated camera rotation and avatar rotation in CAMERA_MODE_THIRD_PERSON_VIEW mode
  - Camera rotates only with right-click drag while avatar direction remains fixed
  - Avatar direction changes only during movement with arrow keys or WASD
  - Restricted roll rotation to prevent camera tilting
  - Implemented quaternion constraints to limit rotation to pitch and yaw only

**Known Issues:**
- Camera roll (z-axis rotation) must be restricted in third-person view to prevent disorienting camera angles
- Need to implement proper constraints on camera rotation to maintain stable viewing angles
